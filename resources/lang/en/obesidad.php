It is calculated by dividing the weight of a person in kilos by the square of its size in meters (kg / m2).</p><p>The definition from the World Health Organization (WHO) is as follows:</p><ul><li>A BMI equal to or greater than 25 is deemed overweight.</li><li>A BMI equal to or greater than 30 signifies obesity.</li></ul><p>The BMI provides the most useful measure of overweight and obesity in the population, since it is the same for both sexes and for adults of all ages. However, it should be considered as an indication because it may not correspond to the same thickness level in different people.</p>',
