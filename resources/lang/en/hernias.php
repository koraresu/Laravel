The annoyance can be worse when standing, straining or lifting heavy objects. As the hernia progresses, the most common hernia symptom is a bulge that is sensitive and growing.</p><p>When a hernia enlarges, it can get stuck inside the hole and lose its blood supply, which is called strangulation. Hernia symptoms when an area of the intestine has lost blood supply include nausea and vomiting and not being able to eliminate gas or have bowel movements. When this happens, emergency surgery is needed.</p>',
