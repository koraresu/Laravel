The diaphragm is the muscular layer that separates the chest cavity from the abdomen and there is an opening in the diaphragm, called the hiatus, that allows the esophagus (the food pipe) to pass through and attach to the stomach. A Hiatal Hernia occurs when the stomach bulges up through that same opening.</p>',
